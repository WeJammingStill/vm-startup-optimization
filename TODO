# Virtual Machine Optimization

1. Collect the benchmarks and methods used to create mini-vm and rebuild those mini-VMs for benchmarks. []
2. Run the mini-VMs for various benchmarks and compare with regular VMs. (image size, boot time, execution time, other features) []
3. Deduce better methods for creating mini-VMs. Reduce image size, boot time, execution time. []
